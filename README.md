# Realtime-Color-Detection
This Python script uses OpenCV to perform real-time color filtering in the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space. It captures video from a webcam or a mobile camera and allows you to interactively adjust HSV color thresholds using trackbars to filter specific colors in the live feed.
