Title: Real-time HSV Color Filtering with OpenCV

Description:

This Python script uses OpenCV to perform real-time color filtering in the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space. It captures video from a webcam or a mobile camera and allows you to interactively adjust HSV color thresholds using trackbars to filter specific colors in the live feed.

Features:

HSV Color Filtering: The script converts each frame from the webcam feed to the HSV color space, which is particularly useful for color-based object detection.

Trackbars for Adjustment: It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with trackbars for adjusting the minimum and maximum values of hue (H), saturation (S), and value (V). These trackbars allow you to dynamically filter specific colors of interest.

Live Filtering: As you adjust the trackbars, the script instantly updates the filtered result, providing real-time feedback on the selected color range.

Stacked Display: The script stacks the original frame, the mask (filtered result), and the combined result side by side for easy comparison and visualization.

Resizable Windows: Both the HSV window and the stacked display window are resizable, allowing you to work with different screen dimensions.

Exit on 'q': You can exit the script by pressing the 'q' key.

Usage:

Run the script.
Adjust the trackbars to filter the desired color range in real-time.
Observe the stacked display showing the original frame, mask, and filtered result.
Requirements:

Python
OpenCV
NumPy
The 'stack_multi_utils' module (ensure it's available in the same directory or update the import statement)
Note:

You can use this script for various computer vision and image processing tasks, such as object tracking, color segmentation, and more.

Feel free to modify and extend the code for your specific applications and experiments.
